# Visuals

* sprites and world are in pixel art style
    mostly use assets from the sites i linked, really easy to implement
    should we find some more?
    yea we can browse around, there's a lot more on that site for free we can yoink
    
* platformer world
    could implement edge grabbing, jump rolling, etc

* parallax scrolling
    background art has layers for that

* camera
    * follows player
    * shake for on hit effects 

* maybe some pixel sim if feasable? (low prio)
    * flammable oil?
    * sand (patent pending)
    * destructable environments (static objects that have physics)
    * ex: wooden platforms that can be burned by oil barrels when lit on fire

# Gameplay
killing enemies that spawn and upgrade damage/health/etc (maybe unlock new abilities) 

* main goal: ?
    im thinking something of a rogue like where u keep upgrades but enemies never stop spawning, can have different settings (back grounds) with differend mobs, etc


# Storyboard
could be anything generic, we can sit on it for now - keep it on the back burner
kay

i think this looks good for the initial planning
yeah
just to finish, what would be the goal ? could be to reach an end level or defeat a boss

we could do a tpyical rogue like game loop where you
    kill mobs -> collect points/coins -> spend for upgrades -> repeat

oh thats what you mean by rogue
yea not sure if you're familiar with that game mode paradignm, but it's basically where the game's really hard at the start, but as you collect more upgrades (which persists through deaths), it becomes easier
nonono world of warcraft is an mmorpg lol, those are just normal progression
a good example would be Risk of Rain 2, The Binding of Issac, HADES, check them out on youtube
shit i need more game culture hahaha

so basically no end, a bit like our first game but the powerups are really good and they stay lol
yup
okayyy

i guess we can come back on this when the brick breaker is done 
going to bed
alright sweet dreams
ty you too in many hours
a good first step would be 2d physics system + character controller
not sure if there are libs or if we're allowed - we can ask next week
yea but are we doing the physics on our own ? or libs ?
i'm saying this because we had trouble with the corners of rects so a whole world might be hard 
yea good point, im sure there'll be some off the shelf solution so that we won't have to write our own physics engine
ok nice
